# EightBall

This is a simple console application I designed to function like an 8Ball. 

An 8Ball, as the name suggests, is usually a black ball similar to the 
number 8 billiard ball in pool but larger.

The person holding the 8Ball asks it a question about something they're 
undecided on or aren't sure about then shakes it. 

After a second or two, the transparent section of the 8Ball reveals a 
random response to the person, which is usually a few words to a sentence. 

8Balls are mostly normally used by children and young adults as a fun way
of finding out the answers to "life's most pressing questions".

## The Inspiration

The idea first came to me after integrating StreamElements to my Twitch
stream. I noticed a command called !8ball that responded with an answer if
you included it at the end of your sentence/question.

The concept seemed simple enough, so I challenged myself to turn it into a
small project and live streamed the entire process.

I also took this as an opportunity to practice with unit tests, which I've
also included.

## What Next?

For now, this is only my second repo coming from Visual Studio IDE - I
normally use VS Code for initializing repos and anything GitHub related -
so it serves as good practice for following the same process using a 
different medium.

I plan to use this project also to practice things like making branches,
adding a new feature, making a commit, opening a pull request, adding 
comments to that pull request, merging the branches, and deleting the
feature branch after merges have been made (the whole GitHub workflow,
basically).

Who knows, I might even let other people work on this to simulate what it
would be like to have multiple people working on the same project.
